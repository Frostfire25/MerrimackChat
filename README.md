# MerrimackChat

MackChat is a VOIP and text-based user interation program that allows users to host and connect to a webserver to communicate with peers.
The app resembles teamspeak or any VOIP chat system.

Users must host their own server using a packaged jar, which clients can connect to via the servers IP address and port on the
desktop application.

Please report any issues, and ideas and check out the Releases tab for packaged jars.

Enjoy! :)
